# **DevLab Portfolio**

My first project of this year is creating a portfolio website. In order to visit my website, click [this link](https://devlab-portfolio-xi.vercel.app/)

## **How to install**

To install my project, simply click on the `Code` button, then `Download ZIP`. Then unzip it and open `index.html` file.

You can also use click on `Code` and clone with the `HTTPS` or `SSH`.

## **How to modify**

    Prerequirements : node.js installed, sass installed

Id you want to modify the css of this project, I advise you to do it in the scss folder. In order to do that, open the `terminal` and navigate to your folder's directory (for example: `cd C:\Users\user\Documents\Portoflio`). Then, run this command to compile the scss into css: `sass --watch scss:css`.

## **Deployment**

To deploy my portoflio, I used Vercel. To do so, I linked my GitHub account to Vercel and deployed from the main branch of this project's repository. Once deployed, the website will automatically redeploy after any commit.

I also enabled Checkly wich generates a quick visual performance overview. It allows me to be aware of any visual aspect that could be unpleasant for users.

## **Apps**

### • Imgbot

Imgbot is an app that helps reduce images file size. To install, I installed it from the marketplace, linked my GitHub account and activated it on my portfolio's repository. After a commit/push, Imgbot will generate a pull request that will replace my images with lightweight images.

### • CodeFactor

Code factor notifies me whenever it finds an error in my code, and can sometimes suggest autofixes.
