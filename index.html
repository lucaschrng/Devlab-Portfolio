                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>My advanced level allows me to create well structured HTML files with meaningful tags, adequate to their purpose and usage.</p>
                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                    I master CSS to an advanced level, meaning that I have a wide range of knwoledge concerning CSS selectors, animation and transitions. This allows me to optimize code and prevents me from overusing more ressource demanding languages such as Javascript.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Javascript</h3>
                    <p>Having a considerable amount of experience with Javascript and algorythmics languages, I have a deep understanding of the possibilities offered by such tools. Thus, I am able to use Javascript to personalise a website and make it even more unique.
                    </p>
                    <h3>PHP</h3>
                    <p>Knowing the basics of PHP, I can create databases while allowing interactions websites with them, such as pushing, as well as fetching, data to/from databases. For example, I am able to create a sign up/log in system with securely hashed stored passwords.
